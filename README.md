# My Books

My Books is a browser-based web application created as part of my journey through The Odin Project curriculum. This is my eighth project, and it focuses on building a dynamic and interactive book library application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to add, remove, and mark books as read or unread, keeping track of their personal library.

## How to Use

- 📚 **Add New Books:** Click the "New Book" button to open a dialog where you can enter the title, author, number of pages, and whether you've read the book.
- 🗑️ **Remove Books:** Each book card contains a "remove" button to delete a book from your library.
- ✅ **Mark Books as Read:** Books can be marked as read or unread by clicking the "Read" button on each book card.

## Features

- 🖥️ **User-Friendly Interface:** The app provides a clean, easy-to-use interface to manage your book collection.
- 📚 **Add and Remove Books:** Easily add new books to your collection or remove them as you please.
- ✅ **Mark Books as Read/Unread:** Keep track of the books you’ve read with a simple toggle between "Read" and "Not Read."
- 🛠️ **Responsive Design:** Although optimized for desktop, the app maintains a visually appealing layout.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Used for creating the structure of the application, including the form and display elements.
- **CSS3:** Provides styling for a user-friendly and visually pleasant experience.
- **JavaScript:** Implements the functionality to manage books, including adding/removing books, marking as read, and storing book data.
- **Local Storage (Optional for future):** Potential for storing books in the browser for persistence across sessions.

## Project Structure

### Files and Directories

- 📄 `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure and layout of the application.
- 🎨 `styles.css`: The stylesheet that defines the layout and design of the app.
- 📜 `script.js`: The JavaScript file that adds interactivity, such as adding/removing books and marking them as read.

## Learning Objectives

This project was built with the following objectives:

- 🏗 **HTML and CSS Layout:** Building the structure and styling of a book management app.
- 🎨 **JavaScript Functionality:** Adding interactivity and dynamic behavior, such as adding/removing books and toggling read/unread status.
- 📊 **DOM Manipulation:** Mastering the use of JavaScript to modify and interact with DOM elements dynamically.

## Future Improvements

- 🔄 **Local Storage Integration:** Saving the book library to the browser's local storage for persistence even when the page is reloaded.
- 📱 **Mobile Optimization:** Making the app mobile-friendly for better usability on smaller screens.
- 🎨 **Theme Toggle:** Implementing a light/dark theme option for enhanced user experience.
